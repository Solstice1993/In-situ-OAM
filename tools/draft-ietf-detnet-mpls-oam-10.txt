Abstract

   This document defines format and use principles of the Deterministic
   Network (DetNet) service Associated Channel (ACH) over a DetNet
   network with the MPLS data plane.  The DetNet service ACH can be used
   to carry test packets of active Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance protocols that are used to detect DetNet failures and
   measure performance metrics.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8655] introduces and explains Deterministic Networks (DetNet)
   architecture and how the Packet Replication, Elimination, and
   Ordering functions (PREOF) can be used to ensure a low packet drop
   ratio in a DetNet domain.

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols are used
   to detect and localize network defects, and to monitor network
   performance.  Some OAM functions (e.g., failure detection) are
   usually performed proactively in the network, while others (e.g.,
   defect localization) are typically performed on demand.  These tasks
   can be achieved through a combination of active and hybrid, as
   defined in [RFC7799], OAM methods.

   Also, this document defines format and use principles of the DetNet
   service Associated Channel over a DetNet network with the MPLS data
   plane [RFC8964].

3.  Active OAM for DetNet Networks with MPLS Data Plane

   OAM protocols and mechanisms act within the data plane of the
   particular networking layer, thus it is critical that the data plane
   encapsulation supports OAM mechanisms that comply with the OAM
   requirements listed in [I-D.ietf-detnet-oam-framework].  One such
   example that requires special consideration is requirement #5:

      DetNet OAM packets MUST be in-band, i.e., follow precisely the
      same path as DetNet data plane traffic both for unidirectional and
      bi-directional DetNet paths.

   Operation of a DetNet data plane with an MPLS underlay network is
   specified in [RFC8964].  Within the MPLS underlay network, DetNet
   flows are to be encapsulated analogous to pseudowires as specified in
   [RFC3985], [RFC4385].  For reference, the Generic PW MPLS CW (as
   defined in [RFC4385] and used with DetNet) is reproduced in Figure 1.

   PREOF in the DetNet domain is composed of a combination of nodes that
   perform replication and elimination functions.  The Elimination sub-
   function always uses the S-Label in conjunction with the packet
   sequencing information (i.e., the Sequence Number encoded in the
   d-CW).  The Replication sub-function uses the S-Label information
   only.  An example of a PREOF sequence of operations for data packets
   in a DetNet domain is shown in Figure 2.

3.1.  DetNet Active OAM Encapsulation

   DetNet OAM, like PW OAM, uses PW Associated Channel Header defined in
   [RFC4385].  At the same time, a DetNet PW can be viewed as a Multi-
   Segment PW, where DetNet service sub-layer functions are at the
   segment endpoints.  However, DetNet service sub-layer functions
   operate per packet level (not per segment level).  These per-packet
   level characteristics of PREOF require additional fields for proper
   OAM packet processing.  Encapsulation of a DetNet MPLS [RFC8964]
   active OAM packet is shown in Figure 3.

   The d-ACH encodes the following fields:

      Bits 0..3 MUST be 0b0001.  This value of the first nibble
      distinguishes an IP packet [RFC4928] from a DetNet data packet
      [RFC8964].

      Version - is a 4-bit field, and the value is the version number of
      the d-ACH.  Version field is needed if the update to d-ACH can not
      be introduced in a backward-compatible way.  This specification
      defines version 0x1 to further differentiate d-ACH from PW ACH
      defined in [RFC4385].

      Sequence Number - is an unsigned 8-bit field.  The sequence number
      space is circular with no restriction on the initial value.  The
      originator DetNet node MUST set the value of the Sequence Number
      field before the transmission of a packet.  The originator node
      MUST increase the value of the Sequence Number field by 1 for each
      active OAM packet.

      Channel Type - is a 16-bit field, and the value of DetNet
      Associated Channel Type.  It MAY be one of the values defined in
      the IANA MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types
      (including Pseudowire Associated Channel Types) registry
      [IANA-G-ACh-Types].  New values can be defined in the future.

      Node ID - is an unsigned 20-bit field.  The value of the Node ID
      field identifies the DetNet node that originated the packet.
      Methods of distributing Node ID are outside the scope of this
      specification.

      Level - is a 3-bit field.  Level field is used to cope with the
      "all active path forwarding" characteristics of the PREOF concept.
      A hierarchical relationship between OAM domains can be created
      using the Level field value.

      Flags - is a 5-bit field.  Flags field contains five 1-bit flags.
      Section 5.1 creates an IANA registry for new flags to be defined.

      distinguish OAM sessions originated from the same node (a given
      Maintenance End Point may have multiple simultaneously active OAM
      sessions).

   The DetNet flow, according to [RFC8964], is identified by the S-label
   that MUST be at the bottom of the stack.  An Active OAM packet MUST
   include d-ACH immediately following the S-label.

3.2.  DetNet Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions
      Interaction with Active OAM

   At the DetNet service sub-layer, special functions (notably PREOF)
   MAY be applied to the particular DetNet flow to potentially lower
   packet loss, improve the probability of on-time packet delivery, and
   ensure in-order packet delivery.  PREOF relies on sequencing
   information in the DetNet service sub-layer.  For a DetNet active OAM
   packet, PREOF MUST use the bit string from bit 4 through bit 31
   inclusive of the first 32-bit word of the d-ACH, i.e., the
   concatenation of Version, Sequence Number, and Channel Type fields,
   as the source of this sequencing information.

4.  OAM Interworking Models

   Interworking of two OAM domains that utilize different networking
   technology can be realized either by a peering or a tunneling model.
   In a peering model, OAM domains are within the corresponding network
   domain.  When using the peering model, state changes that are
   detected by a Fault Management OAM protocol can be mapped from one
   OAM domain into another or a notification, e.g., an alarm, can be
   sent to a central controller.  In the tunneling model of OAM
   interworking, usually, only one active OAM protocol is used.  Its
   test packets are tunneled through another domain along with the data
   flow, thus ensuring the fate sharing among test and data packets.

4.1.  OAM of DetNet MPLS Interworking with OAM of TSN

   Active DetNet OAM can be used to provide the E2E fault management and
   performance monitoring for a DetNet flow.  In the case of DetNet with
   an MPLS data plane and a TSN underlay network, this implies
   interworking of DetNet active OAM with TSN OAM, which is specified in
   [RFC9037].

   When the peering model is used in CFM OAM, then the node that borders
   both TSN and DetNet MPLS domains MUST support [RFC7023].  [RFC7023]
   specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet Attachment
   Circuits and associated Ethernet PWs that are part of an E2E emulated
   Ethernet service, and are also applicable to E2E OAM across DetNet
   MPLS and TSN domains.  The Connectivity Fault Management protocol
   [IEEE.CFM] or in [ITU.Y1731] can provide fast detection of a failure
   in the TSN segment of the DetNet service.  In the DetNet MPLS domain
   BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection), specified in [RFC5880] and
   [RFC5885], can be used.  To provide E2E failure detection, the TSN
   and DetNet MPLS segments could be treated as concatenated such that
   the diagnostic codes (see Section 6.8.17 of [RFC5880]) MAY be used to
   inform the upstream DetNet MPLS node of a failure of the TSN segment.
   Performance monitoring can be supported by [RFC6374] in the DetNet

Internet-Draft          OAM for DetNet over MPLS           December 2022


   MPLS and [ITU.Y1731] in the TSN domains, respectively.  Performance
   objectives for each domain should refer to metrics that additive or
   be defined for each domain separately.

   The following considerations apply when using the tunneling model of
   OAM interworking between DetNet MPLS and TSN domains based on general
   principles described in Section 4 [RFC9037]:

   *  Active OAM test packets MUST be mapped to the same TSN Stream ID
      as the monitored DetNet flow.

   *  Active OAM test packets MUST be treated in the TSN domain based on
      its S-label and Class of Service marking (the Traffic Class field
      value).

   Note that the tunneling model of the OAM interworking requires that
   the remote peer of the E2E OAM domain supports the active OAM
   protocol selected on the ingress endpoint.  For example, if BFD is
   used for proactive path continuity monitoring in the DetNet MPLS
   domain, BFD support (as defined in [RFC5885]) is necessary at any TSN
   endpoint of the DetNet service.

4.2.  OAM of DetNet MPLS Interworking with OAM of DetNet IP

   Interworking between active OAM segments in DetNet MPLS and DetNet IP
   domains can also be realized using either the peering or the
   tunneling model, as discussed in Section 4.1.  Using the same
   protocol, e.g., BFD, over both segments, simplifies the mapping of
   errors in the peering model.  To provide performance monitoring over
   a DetNet IP domain, STAMP [RFC8762] and its extensions [RFC8972] can
   be used.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  DetNet MPLS OAM Flags Registry

   This document describes a new IANA-managed registry to identify
   DetNet MPLS OAM Flags bits.  The registration procedure is "IETF
   Review" [RFC8126].  The registry name is "DetNet MPLS OAM Flags".
   IANA should treat "DetNet MPLS OAM Flags" as the name of the registry
   group.  There are five flags in the five-bit Flags field, defined as
   in Table 1.
